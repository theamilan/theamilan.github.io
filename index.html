      <h2>About Thea</h2>
        I am a marketing specialist who has worked in a variety of industries with a wide set of skills. Half of my career was focused on event planning and the other half consisted of all aspects of online marketing: website management, email marketing, SEM including SEO and PPC, and social media marketing. I want to get my focus back on online marketing and even learning more about development and design to include in my skillset.</div>

        <h3>Event planning</h3>
          Trade shows, webinars, on the road shows (trainings), and networking events are my bread and butter. I not only plan and manage the shows, but I also create all the marketing campaigns for pre-show, during the show, and post show.
        <h3>Email Marketing</h3>
        <h3>Social Media Marketing</h3>
        <h3>SEM - SEO & PPC</h3>
          I started learning SEM techniques during my time at Piping Technology and Products. I managed their website and used  HubSpot's Website Grading tool to help manage keywords and figure out what types of improvements to make on their websites. I also managed their Google Ads and Facebook Ads</div>

          I've always been interested in coding and learned basic HTML in high school. From there I was able to continue learning throughout my internships by managing their website and emails. I have gone through some basic coding classes through Coursera and am now taking classes through Coding Academy.
