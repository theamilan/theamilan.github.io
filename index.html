    <div class="about"><h2>About Thea</h2>
    I am a marketing specialist who has worked in a variety of industries with a wide set of skills. Half of my career was focused on event planning and the other half consisted of all aspects of online marketing: website management, email marketing, SEM including SEO and PPC, and social media marketing. I want to get my focus back on online marketing and even learning more about development and design to include in my skillset.</div>

    <h3>Event planning</h3>
    Trade shows, webinars, on the road shows (trainings), and networking events are my bread and butter. I not only plan and manage the shows, but I also create all the marketing campaigns for pre-show, during the show, and post show.
    <h3>Website Management (Soon to be Development and Design)</h3>

I have gone through some basic coding classes through Coursera and am now taking classes through Coding Academy.</div>
